Raymond Smullyan's _To Mock a Mockingbird_ explores various problems in combinatory logic through the extended metaphor of a forest full of birds. Each bird represents a combinator function: a simple, generic, often higher-order function that operates on no variables other than its arguments. (The Mockingbird, for example, takes one argument and returns the result of invoking it with itself: `const Mockingbird = x => x(x)`).

This repo captures notes and solutions from working through Smullyan's puzzles. (So far, I've only been able to figure out #7 without checking the answers, which can be quite denseâ€”these notes are for explaining the answers to myself.)
