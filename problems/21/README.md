### Conditions
* There is an identity bird `I`
* Every bird is fond of at least one bird

### Problem
Is `I` necessarily agreeable?

### Solution
Yes. If every bird is fond of at least one bird; arbitrary bird `x` is fond of `y`. That means `x(y) === y`. But `I(y) === y` as well, meaning `I` agrees with every bird and is therefore agreeable.
