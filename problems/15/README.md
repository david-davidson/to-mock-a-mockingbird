# Hopeless Egocentricity Is Contagious!

### Problem
Prove that if `A` is hopelessly egocentric, then for every bird `x`, so is `A(x)`.

### Solution
Suppose `A` is hopelessly egocentric. We've [already proved](../14/README.md) that, for any birds `x` and `y`, `A(x)(y) === A`. We also know that `A(x) === A`, simply because of `A`'s hopeless egocentricity. Since they're both equal to `A`, `A(x)(y)` and `A(x)` are equivalent. And, if `A(x)(y) === A(x)`, `A(x)` is hopelessly egocentric.

### Notes
Smullyan's solution here seems unnecessarily complicated. From `A`'s hopeless egocentricity, we already know that `A(x)` is equal to `A`, and we already know that `A` is hopelessly egocentric. Why get `y` involved?
