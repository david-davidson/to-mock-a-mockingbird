# Another Riddle

### Problem
Why is a hopelessly egocentric Lark unusually attractive?

### Solution
We've shown, in [#25](../problems/25), that every bird `x` is fond of `L(x)(L(x))`. But, substituting for `L`'s return values in the latter expression, we get: `L(x)(L(x))` => `L(x)(L)` (because `L` is hopelessly egocentric, `L(x) => L`) => `L(L)` => `L`. Therefore, every bird `x` is fond of `L`.
