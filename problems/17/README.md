# A Fact about Fixation

### Problem
It's impossible for a bird to be fixated on more than one bird. Show why.

### Solution
This seems obviously true on its face: when a bird is fixated on another, it returns _only_ that bird. Smullyan proves it by assuming that a bird `A` is fixated on both `x` and `y`, then showing that `x` and `y` are equal.

Take a third bird `z`. `A(z) === x`, because `A` is fixated on `x`. But `A(z) === y`, because `A` is fixated on `y`. Because both `x` and `y` are equal to `A(z)`, they are equal to each other.
