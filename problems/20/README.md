### Conditions
* The forest contains the identity bird, `I`, where `I(x) => x`
* `I` is [agreeable](../3/README.md)

### Problem
Is every bird fond of at least one bird?

### Solution
Yes. If `I` is agreeable, then for every bird `x`, there is a bird `y` on which `x` and `I` agree. We know that `I(y) === y`, which means that `x(y) === y` as well. Therefore x is fond of at least one bird: `y`.
